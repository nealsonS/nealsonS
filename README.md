### Hi, I'm Nealson! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate student in USC's M.S Applied Data Science Program and I graduated with a B.S in Statistics & Data Science from UCSB. <br>

In the past, I have worked on projects in Computer vision research, Recommender Systems, Distributed Data Mining using Spark, Database Management Systems, Natural Language Processing, Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, Full Stack Software Development and dimension reduction techniques.

Currently working on:
