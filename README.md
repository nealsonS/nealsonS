### Hi, I'm Nealson! 👋

I'm a graduate student in USC's M.S Applied Data Science Program and I graduated with a B.S in Statistics & Data Science from UCSB. <br>

I am currently working on:
- Creating a ChatBot using LLMs with full data pipeline from source to generation!

In the past, I have worked on projects in NLP, Time Series Analysis, and dimension reduction techniques.
